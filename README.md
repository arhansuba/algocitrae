Bitcoin-Pegged Algorithmic Stablecoin on Citrea
Project Description
The "Bitcoin-Pegged Algorithmic Stablecoin on Citrea" project aims to create an algorithmic stablecoin that maintains a peg to Bitcoin, utilizing Citrea's EVM-compatible ZK-Rollup technology. Drawing inspiration from the Bretton Woods system where currencies were pegged to gold, this stablecoin aims to establish Bitcoin as the modern "gold standard" for stability and value preservation in the digital economy.

Project Plan
Project Overview and Objectives

Objective: Develop an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to Bitcoin using Citrea’s ZK-Rollup technology.
Goals:
Design an algorithmic mechanism to stabilize the stablecoin's value relative to Bitcoin.
Implement smart contracts for issuance, redemption, and governance on Citrea.
Utilize Citrea’s zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy and scalability.
Research and Conceptualization

Stablecoin Mechanisms:
Study existing algorithmic stablecoin models (e.g., Terra, Ampleforth) to understand their mechanisms.
Analyze Bitcoin's price volatility and develop robust mechanisms for stablecoin peg maintenance.
Citrea Capabilities:
Understand Citrea’s ZK-Rollup technology, its integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and interoperability with the Bitcoin network.
Explore how Citrea’s features can enhance stability, scalability, and user privacy for the stablecoin ecosystem.
Technical Architecture

Smart Contract Design:
